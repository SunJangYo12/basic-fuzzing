<meta name="description" content="Introduction We’ve already discussed the importance of code coverage previously in this series so today we’ll try to understand some of the very basic underlying concepts, some common approaches, some tooling, and also see what techniques some popular fuzzing frameworks are capable of leveraging. We’re going to shy away from some of the more esoteric strategies and try to focus on what would be called the ‘bread and butter’, well-trodden subject areas. So if you’re new to fuzzing, new to software testing, this blogpost should be friendly. I’ve found that a lot of the terminology used in this space is intuitive and easy to understand, but there are some outliers. Hopefully this helps you at least get on your way doing your own research. We will do our best to not get bogged down in definitional minutiae, and instead will focus on just learning stuff. I’m not a computer scientist and the point of this blogpost is to merely introduce you to these concepts so that you can understand their utility in fuzzing. In that spirit, if you find any information that is misleading, egregiously incorrect, please let me know. Thanks to all that have been so charitable on Twitter answering questions and helping me out along the way, people like: @gamozolabs, @domenuk, @is_eqv, @d0c_s4vage, and @naehrdine just to name a few :) Core Definitions One of the first things we need to do is get some definitions out of the way. These definitions will be important as we will build upon them in the subsequent explanations/explorations. Code Coverage Code coverage is any metric that gives you insight into how much of a program’s code has been reached by a test, input, etc. We won’t spend a lot of time here as we’ve already previously discussed code coverage in previous posts. Code coverage is very important to fuzzing as it allows you to keep track of how much surface area in the target program you are able to reach. You can imagine that if you only explore a small % of the program space, your testing might be limited in comprehensiveness. Basic Blocks Let’s get the Wikipedia definition out of the way first: “In compiler construction, a basic block is a straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.” So a ‘basic block’ is a code sequence that is executed linearly where there is no opportunity for the code execution path to branch into separate directions. Let’s come up with a visual example. Take the following dummy program that gets a password via the command line and then checks that it meets password length requirements: #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> int length_check(char* password) { long i = 0; while (password[i] != '\0') { i++; } if (i < 8 || i > 20) { return 0; } return 1; } int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if (argc != 2) { printf(&quot;usage: ./passcheck <password>\n&quot;); printf(&quot;usage: ./passcheck mysecretpassword2021\n&quot;); exit(-1); } int result = length_check(argv[1]); if (!result) { printf(&quot;password does not meet length requirements\n&quot;); exit(-1); } else { printf(&quot;password meets length requirements\n&quot;); } } Once we get this compiled and analyzed in Ghidra, we can see the following graph view of main(): ‘Blocks’ is one of those intuitive terms, we can see how the graph view automatically breaks down main() into blocks of code. If you look inside each block, you will see that code execution is unidirectional, there are no opportunities inside of a block to take two or more different paths. The code execution is on rails and the train track has no forks. You can see that blocks terminate in this example with conditional jumps (JZ, JNZ), main returning, and function calls to exit. Edges/Branches/Transitions ‘Edge’ is one of those terms in CS/graph theory that I don’t think is super intuitive and I much prefer ‘Transition’ or ‘Branch’, but essentially this is meant to capture relationships between basic blocks. Looking back at our basic block graph from Ghidra, we can see that a few different relationships exist, that is to say that there are multiple pathways code execution can take depending on a few conditions. Basic block 001006cf has a relationship with two different blocks: 001006e4 and 00100706. So code execution inside of 001006cf can reach either of the two blocks it has a relationship with depending on a condition. That condition in our case is the JZ operation depending on whether or not the number of command line arguments is 2: if the number of arguments is not 2, we branch to block 001006e4 organically by just not taking the conditional jump (JZ) if the number of arguments is 2, we branch to block 00100706 by taking the conditional jump These two possibilities can be referred to as ‘Edges’, so block 01006cf has two edges. You can imagine how this might be important from the perspective of fuzzing. If our fuzzer is only ever exploring one of a basic block’s edges, we are leaving an entire branch untested so it would behoove us to track this type of information. There’s apparently much more to this concept than I let on here, you can read more on the Wikipedia entry for Control-flow_graph. Paths ‘Path’ is just the list of basic blocks our program execution traversed. Looking at our example program, there a few different paths as illustrated below with the orange, green and red lines. Path One: 0x001006cf -> 0x001006e4 Path Two: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x00100738 Path Three: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x0000722 Instrumentation In this blogpost, “Instrumentation” will refer to the process of equipping your fuzzing target with the ability to provide code coverage feedback data. This could mean lots of things. It could be as complex as completely rewriting a compiled binary blob that we have no source code for or as simple as placing a breakpoint on the address of every basic block entry address. One of the important aspects of instrumentation to keep in mind is the performance penalty incurred by your instrumentation. If your instrumentation provides 50% more useful information than a technique that is 50% less useful but 1000x more performant, you have to consider the tradeoffs. The 50% more data might very well be worth the huge performance penalty, it just depends. Binary Only This is a simple one, “Binary Only” refers to targets that we don’t have source code for. So all we have to work with is a binary blob. It can be dynamically linked or static. These types of targets are more prevalent in certain environments, think embedded targets, MacOS, and Windows. There are still binary-only targets on Linux though, they’re just less common. Even though “binary only” is simple to understand, the implications for gathering code coverage data are far-reaching. A lot of popular code coverage mechanisms rely upon having source code so that the target can be compiled in a certain way that lends itself well to gathering coverage data, for binary-only targets we don’t have the luxury of compiling the target the way that we want. We have to deal with the compiled target the way it is. Common Strategies In this section we’ll start looking at common strategies fuzzing tools utilize to gather code coverage data. Tracking Basic Blocks One of the most simple ways to gather code coverage is to simply track how many basic blocks are reached by a given input. You can imagine that we are exploring a target program with our inputs and we want to know what code has been reached. Well, we know that given our definition of basic blocks above, if we enter a basic block we will execute all of the code within, so if we just track whether or not a basic block has been reached, we will at least know what paths we have not yet hit and we can go manually inspect them. This approach isn’t very sophisticated and kind of offers little in the way of high-fidelity coverage data; however, it is extremely simple to implement and works with all kinds of targets. Don’t have source? Throw some breakpoints on it. Don’t have time to write compiler code? Throw some breakpoints on it. Performance wise, this technique is great. Hitting new coverage will entail hitting a breakpoint, removing the breakpoint and restoring the original contents that were overwritten during instrumentation, saving the input that reached the breakpoint, and continuing on. These events will actually be slow when they occur; however, as you progress through your fuzzing campaign, new coverage becomes increasingly rare. So there is an upfront cost that eventually decreases to near-zero as time goes by. I’d say that in my limited experience, this type of coverage is typically employed against closed-source targets (binary-only) where our options are limited and this low-tech method works well enough. Let’s check out @gamozolabs really fast Basic Block tracking coverage tool called Mesos. You can see that it is aimed at use on Windows where most targets will be binary-only. The neat thing about this tool is its performance. You can see his benchmark results in the README: Registered 1000000 breakpoints in 0.162230 seconds | 6164072.8 / second Applied 1000000 breakpoints in 0.321347 seconds | 3111897.0 / second Cleared 1000000 breakpoints in 0.067024 seconds | 14920028.6 / second Hit 100000 breakpoints in 10.066440 seconds | 9934.0 / second One thing to keep in mind is that if you use this way of collecting coverage data, you might limit yourself to the first input that reaches a basic block. Say for instance we have the following code: // input here is an unsigned char buff if (input[0x9] < 220) { parsing_routine_1(input); } else { parsing_routine_2(input); } If our first input to reach this code has a value of 200 inside of input[0x9], then we will progress to the parsing_routine_1 block entry. We will remove our breakpoint at the entry of parsing_routine_1 and we will add the input that reached it to our corpus. But now that we’ve reached our block with an input that had a value of 200, we’re kind of married to that value as we will never hit this breakpoint again with any of the other values that would’ve reached it as well. So we’ll never save an input to the corpus that “solved” this basic block a different way. This can be important. Let’s say parsing_routine_1 then takes the entire input, and reads through the input byte-by-byte for the entirety of the input’s length and does some sort of lengthy parsing at each iteration. And let’s also say there are no subsequent routines that are highly stateful where large inputs vary drastically from smaller inputs in behavior. What if the first input we gave the program that solved this block is 1MB in size? Our fuzzers are kind of married to the large input we saved in the corpus and we were kind of unlucky that shorter input didn’t solve this block first and this could hurt performance. One way to overcome this problem would be to just simply re-instantiate all of your breakpoints periodically. Say you have been running your fuzzer for 10 billion fuzz-cases and haven’t found any new coverage in 24 hours, you could at that point insert all of your already discovered breakpoints once again and try to solve the blocks in a different way perhaps saving a smaller more performant input that solved the block with a input[0x9] = 20. Really there a million different ways to solve this problem. I believe @gamozolabs addressed this exact issue before on Twitter but I wasn’t able to find the post. All in all, this is a really effective coverage method especially given the variety of targets it works for and how simple it is to implement. Tracking Edges and Paths Tracking edges is very popular because this is the strategy employed by AFL and its children. This is the approach where we not only care about what basic blocks are being hit but also, what relationships are being explored between basic blocks. The AFL++ stats output has references to both paths and edges and implicitly ‘counters’. I’m not 100% sure but I believe their definition of a ‘path’ matches up to ours above. I think they are saying that a ‘path’ is the same as a testcase in their documentation. I won’t get too in-depth here analyzing how AFL and its children (really AFL++ is quite different than AFL) collect and analyze coverage for a simple reason: it’s for big brain people and I don’t understand much of it. If you’re interested in a more detailed breakdown, head on over to their docs and have a blast. To track edges, AFL uses tuples of the block addresses involved in the relationship. So in our example program, if we went from block 0x001006cf to block 0x001006e4 because we didn’t provide the correct number of command line arguments, this tuple (0x001006cf , 0x001006e4) would be added to a coverage map AFL++ uses to track unique paths. So let’s track the tuples we would register if we traversed an entire path in our program: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x00100722 If we take the above path, we can formulate two tuples of coverage data: (0x001006cf, 0x00100706) and (0x00100706, 0x00100722). These can be looked up in AFL’s coverage data to see if these relationships have been explored before. Not only does AFL track these relationships, it also tracks frequency. So for instance, it is aware of how often each particular edge is reached and explored. This kind of coverage data is way more complex than merely tracking basic blocks reached; however, getting this level of detail is also not nearly as straightforward. In the most common case, AFL gets this data by using compile-time instrumentation on the target. You can compile your target, that you have source code for, using the AFL compiler which will emit compiled code with the instrumentation embedded in the target. This is extremely nifty. But it requires access to source code which isn’t always possible. AFL has an answer for binary-only targets as well and leverages the powerful QEMU emulator to gather similarly detailed coverage data. Emulators have relatively free access to this type of data since they have to take the target instructions and either interpret them (which means simulate their execution) or JIT (just-in-time) compile the blocks into native code and execute them natively. In the case of QEMU here, blocks are JIT’d into native code and stored in a cache so that it could be easily used again by subsequent executions. So when QEMU comes upon a basic block, it can check whether or not this block has been compiled or not already and act accordingly. AFL utilizes this process to track what blocks are being executed and gets very similar data to what it gathers with compile time instrumentation. I don’t understand all of the nuance here, but a great blogpost to read on the subject is: @abiondo’s post explaining an optimization they made to AFL QEMU mode in 2018. In a grossly short (hopefully not too inaccurate) summary, QEMU would pre-compute what are called direct jumps and compile those blocks into a single block essentially (via keeping execution in natively compiled blocks) as a way to speed things up. Take this toy example for instance: ADD RAX, 0x8 JMP LAB_0x00100738 Here we have a pre-computable destination to our jump. We know the relative offset to LAB_0x00100738 from our current address (absolute value of current_addr - LAB_0x00100738), so in an emulator we could just take that jump and replace the destination to the compiled block of LAB_0x00100738 and no calculations would need to take place during each execution (only the initial one to calculate the relative offset). This would allow the emulator to progress with native execution without going back into what I would call a ‘simulation-mode’ where it has to calculate the address before jumping to it each time its executed. This is called “block-chaining” in QEMU. Well you can imagine that if this occurs, that huge block of natively executed code (that is really two blocks) is completely opaque to AFL as it’s unaware that two blocks are contained and so it cannot log the edge that was taken. So as a work around, AFL would patch QEMU to no longer do this block-chaining and keep every block isolated so that edges could be tracked. This would mean that at the end of every block, direct jump or not, QEMU would go back into that ‘simulation-mode’ which would incur a performance penalty. Definitely read through @abiondo’s blogpost though, it’s much more informative. If you’re wondering what an indirect jump would be, it would be something where the jump location is only known at execution time, something that could look like this in a toy example: ADD RAX, 0x8 JMP RAX The only issue with using QEMU to gather our coverage data is it is relatively slow compared to purely native execution. This slowdown can be worth it obviously as the amount of data you get is substantial and sometimes with binary-only targets there are no other alternatives. Compare Coverage/Compare Shattering Instead of merely tracking an input or test’s progress through a program’s blocks/edges, compare coverage seeks to understand how much progress our test is making in the program’s comparisons. Comparisons can be done different ways but a common one already exists in our example password program. In the 001006cf block, we have a CMP operation being performed here: CMP dword ptr [RBP + local_1c], 0x2 A dword is a 4 byte value (32 bits) and this operation is taking our argc value in our program and comparing it with 0x2 to check how many command line arguments were provided. So our two comparison operands are whatever is on the stack at the offset RBP + local_1c and 0x2. If these operands are equal, the Zero Flag will be set and we can utilize a conditional jump with JZ to move accordingly in the program. But the problem, as it relates to fuzzing, is that this comparison is rather binary. It either sets the Zero Flag or it does not, there is no nuance. We cannot tell how close we came to passing the comparison, to setting the Zero Flag. So for example, let’s say we were doing a comparison with 0xdeadbeef instead of 0x2. In that case, if we were to submit 0xdeadbebe for the other operand, we’d be much closer to satisfying the JZ condition that we would be if we submitted 0x0. At a high-level, compare coverage breaks this comparison down into chunks so that progress through the comparison can be tracked with more much granularity than a binary PASS/FAIL. So using compare coverage, this comparison might instead be rewritten as follows: BEFORE: Does 0xdeadbebe == 0xdeadbeef ? AFTER: Does 0xde == 0xde ? If so, log that we’ve matched the first byte, and does 0xad == 0xad ? If so, log that we’ve matched the second byte, and does 0xbe == 0xbe ? If so, log that we’ve matched the third byte, and does 0xbe == 0xef ? If so, log that we’ve matched both operands completely. In our AFTER rewrite, instead of getting a binary PASS/FAIL, we instead see that we progressed 75% of the way through the comparison matching 3 out of 4 bytes. Now we know that we can save this input and mutate it further hoping that we can pass the final byte comparison with a correct mutation. We also aren’t restricted to only breaking down each comparison to bytes, we could instead compare the two operands at the bit-level. For instance we could’ve also compared them as follows: 1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1110 1111 vs 1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1011 1110 This could be broken down into 32 separate comparisons instead of our 4, giving us even more fidelity and progress tracking (probably at the expense of performance in practice). Here we took a 4 byte comparison and broke it down into 4 separate single-byte comparisons. This is also known as “Compare Shattering”. In spirit, it’s very similar to compare coverage. It’s all about breaking down large comparisons into smaller chunks so that progress can be tracked with more fidelity. Some fuzzers take all compare operands, like 0xdeadbeef in this example, and add them to a sort of magic values dictionary that the fuzzer will randomly insert it into its inputs hoping to pass the comparison in the future. You can imagine a scenario where a program checks a large value before branching to a complex routine that needs to be explored. Passing these checks is extremely difficult with just basic coverage and would require a lot of human interaction. One could examine a colored graph in IDA that displayed reached blocks and try to manually figure out what was preventing the fuzzer from reaching unreached blocks and determine that a large 32 byte comparison was being failed. One could then adjust their fuzzer to account for this comparison by means of a dictionary or whatever, but this process is all very manual. There are some really interesting/highly technical means to do this type of thing to both targets with source and binary-only targets! AFL++ features an LLVM mode where you can utilize what they call “laf-intel instrumentation” which is described here and originally written about here. Straight from laf-intel’s blogpost, we can see their example looks extremely similar to the thought experiment we already went through where they have this source code: if (input == 0xabad1dea) { /* terribly buggy code */ } else { /* secure code */ } And this code snippet is ‘de-optimized’ into several smaller comparisons that the fuzzer can measure its progress through: if (input >> 24 == 0xab){ if ((input &amp; 0xff0000) >> 16 == 0xad) { if ((input &amp; 0xff00) >> 8 == 0x1d) { if ((input &amp; 0xff) == 0xea) { /* terrible code */ goto end; } } } } /* good code */ end: This de-optimized code can be emitted when one opts to specify certain environment variables and utilizes afl-clang-fast to compile the target. This is super clever and can really take tons of manual effort out of fuzzing. But what are we to do when we don’t have access to source code and our binary-only target is possibly full of large comparisons? Luckily, there are open-source solutions to this problem as well. Let’s look at one called “TinyInst” by @ifsecure and friends. I can’t get deep into how this tool works technically because I’ve never used it but the README is pretty descriptive! As we can see, it is aimed at MacOS and Windows targets in-keeping with its purpose of instrumenting binary only targets. TinyInst gets us coverage by instrumenting select routines via debugger to change the execution permissions so that any execution (not read or write as these permissions are maintained) access to our instrumented code results in a fault which is then handled by the TinyInst debugger where code execution is redirected a re-written instrumented routine/module. So TinyInst blocks all execution of the original module and instead, redirects all that execution to a rewritten module that is inserted into the program. You can see how powerful this can be as it can allow for the breaking down of large comparisons into much smaller ones in a manner very similar to the laf-intel method but for a target that is already compiled. Look at this cool gif showing compare coverage in action from @ifsecure: [https://twitter.com/ifsecure/status/1298341219614031873?s=20]. You can see that he has a program that checks for an 8 byte value, and his fuzzer makes incremental progress through it until it has solved the comparison. There are some other tools out there that work similarly in theory to TinyInst as well that are definitely worth looking at and they are also mentioned in the README, tools like: DynamoRIO and PIN. It should also be mentioned that AFL++ also has the ability to do compare coverage tracking even in QEMU mode. Bonus Land: Using Hardware to Get Coverage Data That pretty much wraps up the very basics of what type of data we’re interested in, why, and how we might be able to extract it. One type of data extraction method that didn’t come up yet that is particularly helpful for binary-only targets is utilizing your actual hardware to get coverage data. While it’s not really a ‘strategy’ as the others were, it enables the execution of the strategies mentioned above and wasn’t mentioned yet. We won’t get too deep here. Nowadays, CPUs come chock-full of all kinds of utilities that are aimed at high-fidelity performance profiling. These types of utilities can also be wrangled into giving us coverage data. Intel-PT is a utility offered by newer Intel CPUs that allows you to extract information about the software you’re running such as control-flow. Each hardware thread has the ability to store data about the application it is executing. The big hang up with using processor trace is that decoding the trace data that is collected has always been painfully slow and cumbersome to work with. Recently however, @is_eqv and @ms_s3c were able to create a very performant library called libxdc which can be used to decode Intel-PT trace data performantly. The graph included in their README is very cool, you can see how much faster it is than the other hardware-sourced coverage guided fuzzing tools while also collecting the highest-fidelity coverage data, what they call “Full Edge Coverage”. Getting your coverage data straight from the CPU seems ideal haha. So for them to be able to engineer a library that gives you what is essentially perfect coverage, and by the way, doesn’t require source code, seems like a substantial accomplishment. I personally don’t have the engineering chops to deal with this type of coverage at the moment, but one day. A lot of popular fuzzers can utilize Intel-PT right out of the box, fuzzers like: AFL++, honggfuzz, and WinAFL. There are many other such utilities but they are beyond the scope of this introductory blogpost. Conclusion In this post we went over some of the building-block terminology used in the space, some very common fundamental strategies that are employed to get meaningful coverage data, and also some of the tooling that is used to extract the data (and in some cases what fuzzing frameworks use what tooling). It should be mentioned that the popular fuzzing frameworks like AFL++ and honggfuzz go through great lengths to make their frameworks as flexible as possible and work with a wide breadth of targets. They often give you tons of flexibility to employ the coverage data extraction method that’s best suited to your situation. Hopefully this was somewhat helpful to begin to understand some of the problems associated with code coverage as it relates to fuzzing.">

That condition in our case is the JZ operation depending on whether or not the number of command line arguments is 2: if the number of arguments is not 2, we branch to block 001006e4 organically by just not taking the conditional jump (JZ) if the number of arguments is 2, we branch to block 00100706 by taking the conditional jump These two possibilities can be referred to as ‘Edges’, so block 01006cf has two edges. You can imagine how this might be important from the perspective of fuzzing. If our fuzzer is only ever exploring one of a basic block’s edges, we are leaving an entire branch untested so it would behoove us to track this type of information. There’s apparently much more to this concept than I let on here, you can read more on the Wikipedia entry for Control-flow_graph. Paths ‘Path’ is just the list of basic blocks our program execution traversed. Looking at our example program, there a few different paths as illustrated below with the orange, green and red lines. Path One: 0x001006cf -> 0x001006e4 Path Two: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x00100738 Path Three: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x0000722 Instrumentation In this blogpost, “Instrumentation” will refer to the process of equipping your fuzzing target with the ability to provide code coverage feedback data. This could mean lots of things. It could be as complex as completely rewriting a compiled binary blob that we have no source code for or as simple as placing a breakpoint on the address of every basic block entry address. One of the important aspects of instrumentation to keep in mind is the performance penalty incurred by your instrumentation. If your instrumentation provides 50% more useful information than a technique that is 50% less useful but 1000x more performant, you have to consider the tradeoffs. The 50% more data might very well be worth the huge performance penalty, it just depends. Binary Only This is a simple one, “Binary Only” refers to targets that we don’t have source code for. So all we have to work with is a binary blob. It can be dynamically linked or static. These types of targets are more prevalent in certain environments, think embedded targets, MacOS, and Windows. There are still binary-only targets on Linux though, they’re just less common. Even though “binary only” is simple to understand, the implications for gathering code coverage data are far-reaching. A lot of popular code coverage mechanisms rely upon having source code so that the target can be compiled in a certain way that lends itself well to gathering coverage data, for binary-only targets we don’t have the luxury of compiling the target the way that we want. We have to deal with the compiled target the way it is. Common Strategies In this section we’ll start looking at common strategies fuzzing tools utilize to gather code coverage data. Tracking Basic Blocks One of the most simple ways to gather code coverage is to simply track how many basic blocks are reached by a given input. You can imagine that we are exploring a target program with our inputs and we want to know what code has been reached. Well, we know that given our definition of basic blocks above, if we enter a basic block we will execute all of the code within, so if we just track whether or not a basic block has been reached, we will at least know what paths we have not yet hit and we can go manually inspect them. This approach isn’t very sophisticated and kind of offers little in the way of high-fidelity coverage data; however, it is extremely simple to implement and works with all kinds of targets. Don’t have source? Throw some breakpoints on it. Don’t have time to write compiler code? Throw some breakpoints on it. Performance wise, this technique is great. Hitting new coverage will entail hitting a breakpoint, removing the breakpoint and restoring the original contents that were overwritten during instrumentation, saving the input that reached the breakpoint, and continuing on. These events will actually be slow when they occur; however, as you progress through your fuzzing campaign, new coverage becomes increasingly rare. So there is an upfront cost that eventually decreases to near-zero as time goes by. I’d say that in my limited experience, this type of coverage is typically employed against closed-source targets (binary-only) where our options are limited and this low-tech method works well enough. Let’s check out @gamozolabs really fast Basic Block tracking coverage tool called Mesos. You can see that it is aimed at use on Windows where most targets will be binary-only. The neat thing about this tool is its performance. You can see his benchmark results in the README: Registered 1000000 breakpoints in 0.162230 seconds | 6164072.8 / second Applied 1000000 breakpoints in 0.321347 seconds | 3111897.0 / second Cleared 1000000 breakpoints in 0.067024 seconds | 14920028.6 / second Hit 100000 breakpoints in 10.066440 seconds | 9934.0 / second One thing to keep in mind is that if you use this way of collecting coverage data, you might limit yourself to the first input that reaches a basic block. Say for instance we have the following code: // input here is an unsigned char buff if (input[0x9] < 220) { parsing_routine_1(input); } else { parsing_routine_2(input); } If our first input to reach this code has a value of 200 inside of input[0x9], then we will progress to the parsing_routine_1 block entry. We will remove our breakpoint at the entry of parsing_routine_1 and we will add the input that reached it to our corpus. But now that we’ve reached our block with an input that had a value of 200, we’re kind of married to that value as we will never hit this breakpoint again with any of the other values that would’ve reached it as well. So we’ll never save an input to the corpus that “solved” this basic block a different way. This can be important. Let’s say parsing_routine_1 then takes the entire input, and reads through the input byte-by-byte for the entirety of the input’s length and does some sort of lengthy parsing at each iteration. And let’s also say there are no subsequent routines that are highly stateful where large inputs vary drastically from smaller inputs in behavior. What if the first input we gave the program that solved this block is 1MB in size? Our fuzzers are kind of married to the large input we saved in the corpus and we were kind of unlucky that shorter input didn’t solve this block first and this could hurt performance. One way to overcome this problem would be to just simply re-instantiate all of your breakpoints periodically. Say you have been running your fuzzer for 10 billion fuzz-cases and haven’t found any new coverage in 24 hours, you could at that point insert all of your already discovered breakpoints once again and try to solve the blocks in a different way perhaps saving a smaller more performant input that solved the block with a input[0x9] = 20. Really there a million different ways to solve this problem. I believe @gamozolabs addressed this exact issue before on Twitter but I wasn’t able to find the post. All in all, this is a really effective coverage method especially given the variety of targets it works for and how simple it is to implement. Tracking Edges and Paths Tracking edges is very popular because this is the strategy employed by AFL and its children. This is the approach where we not only care about what basic blocks are being hit but also, what relationships are being explored between basic blocks. The AFL++ stats output has references to both paths and edges and implicitly ‘counters’. I’m not 100% sure but I believe their definition of a ‘path’ matches up to ours above. I think they are saying that a ‘path’ is the same as a testcase in their documentation. I won’t get too in-depth here analyzing how AFL and its children (really AFL++ is quite different than AFL) collect and analyze coverage for a simple reason: it’s for big brain people and I don’t understand much of it. If you’re interested in a more detailed breakdown, head on over to their docs and have a blast. To track edges, AFL uses tuples of the block addresses involved in the relationship. So in our example program, if we went from block 0x001006cf to block 0x001006e4 because we didn’t provide the correct number of command line arguments, this tuple (0x001006cf , 0x001006e4) would be added to a coverage map AFL++ uses to track unique paths. So let’s track the tuples we would register if we traversed an entire path in our program: 0x001006cf -> 0x00100706 -> 0x00100722 If we take the above path, we can formulate two tuples of coverage data: (0x001006cf, 0x00100706) and (0x00100706, 0x00100722). These can be looked up in AFL’s coverage data to see if these relationships have been explored before. Not only does AFL track these relationships, it also tracks frequency. So for instance, it is aware of how often each particular edge is reached and explored. This kind of coverage data is way more complex than merely tracking basic blocks reached; however, getting this level of detail is also not nearly as straightforward. In the most common case, AFL gets this data by using compile-time instrumentation on the target. You can compile your target, that you have source code for, using the AFL compiler which will emit compiled code with the instrumentation embedded in the target. This is extremely nifty. But it requires access to source code which isn’t always possible. AFL has an answer for binary-only targets as well and leverages the powerful QEMU emulator to gather similarly detailed coverage data. Emulators have relatively free access to this type of data since they have to take the target instructions and either interpret them (which means simulate their execution) or JIT (just-in-time) compile the blocks into native code and execute them natively. In the case of QEMU here, blocks are JIT’d into native code and stored in a cache so that it could be easily used again by subsequent executions. So when QEMU comes upon a basic block, it can check whether or not this block has been compiled or not already and act accordingly. AFL utilizes this process to track what blocks are being executed and gets very similar data to what it gathers with compile time instrumentation. I don’t understand all of the nuance here, but a great blogpost to read on the subject is: @abiondo’s post explaining an optimization they made to AFL QEMU mode in 2018. In a grossly short (hopefully not too inaccurate) summary, QEMU would pre-compute what are called direct jumps and compile those blocks into a single block essentially (via keeping execution in natively compiled blocks) as a way to speed things up. Take this toy example for instance: ADD RAX, 0x8 JMP LAB_0x00100738 Here we have a pre-computable destination to our jump. We know the relative offset to LAB_0x00100738 from our current address (absolute value of current_addr - LAB_0x00100738), so in an emulator we could just take that jump and replace the destination to the compiled block of LAB_0x00100738 and no calculations would need to take place during each execution (only the initial one to calculate the relative offset). This would allow the emulator to progress with native execution without going back into what I would call a ‘simulation-mode’ where it has to calculate the address before jumping to it each time its executed. This is called “block-chaining” in QEMU. Well you can imagine that if this occurs, that huge block of natively executed code (that is really two blocks) is completely opaque to AFL as it’s unaware that two blocks are contained and so it cannot log the edge that was taken. So as a work around, AFL would patch QEMU to no longer do this block-chaining and keep every block isolated so that edges could be tracked. This would mean that at the end of every block, direct jump or not, QEMU would go back into that ‘simulation-mode’ which would incur a performance penalty. Definitely read through @abiondo’s blogpost though, it’s much more informative. If you’re wondering what an indirect jump would be, it would be something where the jump location is only known at execution time, something that could look like this in a toy example: ADD RAX, 0x8 JMP RAX The only issue with using QEMU to gather our coverage data is it is relatively slow compared to purely native execution. This slowdown can be worth it obviously as the amount of data you get is substantial and sometimes with binary-only targets there are no other alternatives. Compare Coverage/Compare Shattering Instead of merely tracking an input or test’s progress through a program’s blocks/edges, compare coverage seeks to understand how much progress our test is making in the program’s comparisons. Comparisons can be done different ways but a common one already exists in our example password program. In the 001006cf block, we have a CMP operation being performed here: CMP dword ptr [RBP + local_1c], 0x2 A dword is a 4 byte value (32 bits) and this operation is taking our argc value in our program and comparing it with 0x2 to check how many command line arguments were provided. So our two comparison operands are whatever is on the stack at the offset RBP + local_1c and 0x2. If these operands are equal, the Zero Flag will be set and we can utilize a conditional jump with JZ to move accordingly in the program. But the problem, as it relates to fuzzing, is that this comparison is rather binary. It either sets the Zero Flag or it does not, there is no nuance. We cannot tell how close we came to passing the comparison, to setting the Zero Flag. So for example, let’s say we were doing a comparison with 0xdeadbeef instead of 0x2. In that case, if we were to submit 0xdeadbebe for the other operand, we’d be much closer to satisfying the JZ condition that we would be if we submitted 0x0. At a high-level, compare coverage breaks this comparison down into chunks so that progress through the comparison can be tracked with more much granularity than a binary PASS/FAIL. So using compare coverage, this comparison might instead be rewritten as follows: BEFORE: Does 0xdeadbebe == 0xdeadbeef ? AFTER: Does 0xde == 0xde ? If so, log that we’ve matched the first byte, and does 0xad == 0xad ? If so, log that we’ve matched the second byte, and does 0xbe == 0xbe ? If so, log that we’ve matched the third byte, and does 0xbe == 0xef ? If so, log that we’ve matched both operands completely. In our AFTER rewrite, instead of getting a binary PASS/FAIL, we instead see that we progressed 75% of the way through the comparison matching 3 out of 4 bytes. Now we know that we can save this input and mutate it further hoping that we can pass the final byte comparison with a correct mutation. We also aren’t restricted to only breaking down each comparison to bytes, we could instead compare the two operands at the bit-level. For instance we could’ve also compared them as follows: 1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1110 1111 vs 1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1011 1110 This could be broken down into 32 separate comparisons instead of our 4, giving us even more fidelity and progress tracking (probably at the expense of performance in practice). Here we took a 4 byte comparison and broke it down into 4 separate single-byte comparisons. This is also known as “Compare Shattering”. In spirit, it’s very similar to compare coverage. It’s all about breaking down large comparisons into smaller chunks so that progress can be tracked with more fidelity. Some fuzzers take all compare operands, like 0xdeadbeef in this example, and add them to a sort of magic values dictionary that the fuzzer will randomly insert it into its inputs hoping to pass the comparison in the future. You can imagine a scenario where a program checks a large value before branching to a complex routine that needs to be explored. Passing these checks is extremely difficult with just basic coverage and would require a lot of human interaction. One could examine a colored graph in IDA that displayed reached blocks and try to manually figure out what was preventing the fuzzer from reaching unreached blocks and determine that a large 32 byte comparison was being failed. One could then adjust their fuzzer to account for this comparison by means of a dictionary or whatever, but this process is all very manual. There are some really interesting/highly technical means to do this type of thing to both targets with source and binary-only targets! AFL++ features an LLVM mode where you can utilize what they call “laf-intel instrumentation” which is described here and originally written about here. Straight from laf-intel’s blogpost, we can see their example looks extremely similar to the thought experiment we already went through where they have this source code: if (input == 0xabad1dea) { /* terribly buggy code */ } else { /* secure code */ } And this code snippet is ‘de-optimized’ into several smaller comparisons that the fuzzer can measure its progress through: if (input >> 24 == 0xab){ if ((input &amp; 0xff0000) >> 16 == 0xad) { if ((input &amp; 0xff00) >> 8 == 0x1d) { if ((input &amp; 0xff) == 0xea) { /* terrible code */ goto end; } } } } /* good code */ end: This de-optimized code can be emitted when one opts to specify certain environment variables and utilizes afl-clang-fast to compile the target. This is super clever and can really take tons of manual effort out of fuzzing. But what are we to do when we don’t have access to source code and our binary-only target is possibly full of large comparisons? Luckily, there are open-source solutions to this problem as well. Let’s look at one called “TinyInst” by @ifsecure and friends. I can’t get deep into how this tool works technically because I’ve never used it but the README is pretty descriptive! As we can see, it is aimed at MacOS and Windows targets in-keeping with its purpose of instrumenting binary only targets. TinyInst gets us coverage by instrumenting select routines via debugger to change the execution permissions so that any execution (not read or write as these permissions are maintained) access to our instrumented code results in a fault which is then handled by the TinyInst debugger where code execution is redirected a re-written instrumented routine/module. So TinyInst blocks all execution of the original module and instead, redirects all that execution to a rewritten module that is inserted into the program. You can see how powerful this can be as it can allow for the breaking down of large comparisons into much smaller ones in a manner very similar to the laf-intel method but for a target that is already compiled. Look at this cool gif showing compare coverage in action from @ifsecure: [https://twitter.com/ifsecure/status/1298341219614031873?s=20]. You can see that he has a program that checks for an 8 byte value, and his fuzzer makes incremental progress through it until it has solved the comparison. There are some other tools out there that work similarly in theory to TinyInst as well that are definitely worth looking at and they are also mentioned in the README, tools like: DynamoRIO and PIN. It should also be mentioned that AFL++ also has the ability to do compare coverage tracking even in QEMU mode. Bonus Land: Using Hardware to Get Coverage Data That pretty much wraps up the very basics of what type of data we’re interested in, why, and how we might be able to extract it. One type of data extraction method that didn’t come up yet that is particularly helpful for binary-only targets is utilizing your actual hardware to get coverage data. While it’s not really a ‘strategy’ as the others were, it enables the execution of the strategies mentioned above and wasn’t mentioned yet. We won’t get too deep here. Nowadays, CPUs come chock-full of all kinds of utilities that are aimed at high-fidelity performance profiling. These types of utilities can also be wrangled into giving us coverage data. Intel-PT is a utility offered by newer Intel CPUs that allows you to extract information about the software you’re running such as control-flow. Each hardware thread has the ability to store data about the application it is executing. The big hang up with using processor trace is that decoding the trace data that is collected has always been painfully slow and cumbersome to work with. Recently however, @is_eqv and @ms_s3c were able to create a very performant library called libxdc which can be used to decode Intel-PT trace data performantly. The graph included in their README is very cool, you can see how much faster it is than the other hardware-sourced coverage guided fuzzing tools while also collecting the highest-fidelity coverage data, what they call “Full Edge Coverage”. Getting your coverage data straight from the CPU seems ideal haha. So for them to be able to engineer a library that gives you what is essentially perfect coverage, and by the way, doesn’t require source code, seems like a substantial accomplishment. I personally don’t have the engineering chops to deal with this type of coverage at the moment, but one day. A lot of popular fuzzers can utilize Intel-PT right out of the box, fuzzers like: AFL++, honggfuzz, and WinAFL. There are many other such utilities but they are beyond the scope of this introductory blogpost. Conclusion In this post we went over some of the building-block terminology used in the space, some very common fundamental strategies that are employed to get meaningful coverage data, and also some of the tooling that is used to extract the data (and in some cases what fuzzing frameworks use what tooling). It should be mentioned that the popular fuzzing frameworks like AFL++ and honggfuzz go through great lengths to make their frameworks as flexible as possible and work with a wide breadth of targets. They often give you tons of flexibility to employ the coverage data extraction method that’s best suited to your situation. Hopefully this was somewhat helpful to begin to understand some of the problems associated with code coverage as it relates to fuzzing.">

    <h2 id="introduction"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perkenalan</font></font></h2>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kami telah membahas pentingnya cakupan kode sebelumnya dalam seri ini, jadi hari ini kami akan mencoba memahami beberapa konsep dasar yang sangat mendasar, beberapa pendekatan umum, beberapa perkakas, dan juga melihat teknik apa yang dapat dimanfaatkan oleh beberapa kerangka kerja fuzzing populer. Kami akan menghindari beberapa strategi yang lebih esoteris dan mencoba untuk fokus pada apa yang disebut sebagai area subjek yang sudah umum dan sudah sering dibahas. Jadi, jika Anda baru mengenal fuzzing, baru dalam pengujian perangkat lunak, blogpost ini akan ramah. Saya telah menemukan bahwa banyak terminologi yang digunakan dalam bidang ini intuitif dan mudah dipahami, tetapi ada beberapa hal yang tidak lazim. Semoga ini membantu Anda setidaknya untuk memulai melakukan penelitian Anda sendiri.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kami akan berusaha sebaik mungkin untuk tidak terjebak dalam hal-hal yang bersifat definisional, dan sebaliknya akan fokus pada pembelajaran saja. Saya bukan ilmuwan komputer dan inti dari blogpost ini adalah untuk sekadar memperkenalkan Anda pada konsep-konsep ini sehingga Anda dapat memahami kegunaannya dalam fuzzing. Dengan semangat itu, jika Anda menemukan informasi yang menyesatkan, sangat tidak benar, mohon beri tahu saya.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terima kasih kepada semua orang yang telah bermurah hati di Twitter dengan menjawab pertanyaan dan membantu saya selama ini, orang-orang seperti: @gamozolabs, @domenuk, @is_eqv, @d0c_s4vage, dan @naehrdine, hanya untuk menyebutkan beberapa :)</font></font></p>

<h2 id="core-definitions"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Definisi Inti</font></font></h2>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Salah satu hal pertama yang perlu kita lakukan adalah menyingkirkan beberapa definisi. Definisi-definisi ini akan menjadi penting karena kita akan mengembangkannya dalam penjelasan/eksplorasi berikutnya.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="code-coverage"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cakupan Kode</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cakupan kode adalah metrik apa pun yang memberi Anda wawasan tentang seberapa banyak kode program telah dijangkau oleh pengujian, input, dll. Kami tidak akan menghabiskan banyak waktu di sini karena kami telah membahas cakupan kode di posting sebelumnya. Cakupan kode sangat penting untuk fuzzing karena memungkinkan Anda melacak seberapa banyak area permukaan dalam program target yang dapat Anda jangkau. Anda dapat membayangkan bahwa jika Anda hanya menjelajahi sebagian kecil dari ruang program, pengujian Anda mungkin terbatas dalam kelengkapannya.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="basic-blocks"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blok Dasar</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mari kita bahas definisi Wikipedia terlebih dahulu:</font></font></p>

<p><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Dalam </font></font><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">konstruksi kompiler</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">blok dasar</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> adalah urutan kode garis lurus tanpa cabang kecuali ke entri dan tidak ada cabang keluar kecuali di pintu keluar.”</font></font></em></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jadi, 'blok dasar' adalah rangkaian kode yang dieksekusi secara linear, yang tidak memungkinkan jalur eksekusi kode bercabang ke arah yang berbeda. Mari kita buat contoh visual. Ambil program tiruan berikut yang mendapatkan kata sandi melalui baris perintah, lalu periksa apakah program tersebut memenuhi persyaratan panjang kata sandi:</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Blok" adalah salah satu istilah intuitif, kita dapat melihat bagaimana tampilan grafik secara otomatis terbagi </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main()</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">menjadi blok kode. Jika Anda melihat ke dalam setiap blok, Anda akan melihat bahwa eksekusi kode bersifat searah, tidak ada peluang di dalam blok untuk mengambil dua atau lebih jalur yang berbeda. Eksekusi kode berada di rel dan rel kereta tidak memiliki percabangan. Anda dapat melihat bahwa blok diakhiri dalam contoh ini dengan lompatan bersyarat ( </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JNZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">), </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pengembalian, dan pemanggilan fungsi ke </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="edgesbranchestransitions"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tepi/Cabang/Transisi</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Edge" adalah salah satu istilah dalam teori CS/grafik yang menurut saya tidak terlalu intuitif dan saya lebih suka "Transisi" atau "Cabang", tetapi pada dasarnya ini dimaksudkan untuk menangkap hubungan antara blok dasar. Melihat kembali grafik blok dasar kita dari Ghidra, kita dapat melihat bahwa ada beberapa hubungan yang berbeda, artinya ada beberapa jalur yang dapat diambil oleh eksekusi kode tergantung pada beberapa kondisi.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blok dasar </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">memiliki hubungan dengan dua blok berbeda: </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">001006e4</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00100706</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Jadi, eksekusi kode di dalam </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dapat mencapai salah satu dari dua blok yang memiliki hubungan dengannya, tergantung pada suatu kondisi. Kondisi tersebut dalam kasus kita adalah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operasi yang bergantung pada apakah jumlah argumen baris perintah adalah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:</font></font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">jika jumlah argumennya bukan 2, kita bercabang ke blok </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">001006e4</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">secara organik dengan tidak mengambil lompatan kondisional ( </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">)</font></font></li>
  <li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">jika jumlah argumen adalah 2, kita bercabang ke blok </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00100706</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dengan mengambil lompatan bersyarat</font></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kedua kemungkinan ini dapat disebut sebagai 'Edges', jadi blok </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">memiliki dua edge. Anda dapat membayangkan betapa pentingnya hal ini dari perspektif fuzzing. Jika fuzzer kita hanya menjelajahi salah satu edge blok dasar, kita membiarkan seluruh cabang tidak teruji sehingga sebaiknya kita melacak jenis informasi ini.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rupanya masih banyak lagi konsep yang tak saya ungkapkan di sini, Anda dapat membaca lebih lanjut pada entri Wikipedia untuk </font></font><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Control-flow_graph</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">'Path' hanyalah daftar blok dasar yang dilalui oleh eksekusi program kita. Jika kita melihat contoh program kita, ada beberapa path yang berbeda seperti yang diilustrasikan di bawah ini dengan garis oranye, hijau, dan merah.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="instrumentation"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instrumentasi</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dalam blogpost ini, "Instrumentasi" akan merujuk pada proses melengkapi target fuzzing Anda dengan kemampuan untuk menyediakan data umpan balik cakupan kode. Ini bisa berarti banyak hal. Ini bisa serumit menulis ulang blob biner terkompilasi yang tidak memiliki kode sumber atau sesederhana menempatkan breakpoint pada alamat setiap alamat entri blok dasar.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Salah satu aspek penting instrumentasi yang perlu diingat adalah penalti kinerja yang ditimbulkan oleh instrumentasi Anda. Jika instrumentasi Anda memberikan informasi yang 50% lebih bermanfaat daripada teknik yang 50% kurang bermanfaat tetapi 1000x lebih berkinerja, Anda harus mempertimbangkan tradeoff-nya. Data yang 50% lebih banyak mungkin sepadan dengan penalti kinerja yang sangat besar, itu tergantung saja.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="binary-only"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hanya Biner</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ini sederhana saja, “Hanya Biner” merujuk pada target yang kode sumbernya tidak kita miliki. Jadi yang harus kita kerjakan hanyalah blob biner. Blob biner dapat ditautkan secara dinamis atau statis. Jenis target ini lebih umum di lingkungan tertentu, seperti target tertanam, MacOS, dan Windows. Namun, masih ada target biner di Linux, hanya saja kurang umum.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meskipun "hanya biner" mudah dipahami, implikasi untuk pengumpulan data cakupan kode sangat luas. Banyak mekanisme cakupan kode populer bergantung pada kode sumber sehingga target dapat dikompilasi dengan cara tertentu yang sesuai untuk pengumpulan data cakupan, untuk target hanya biner, kita tidak memiliki kemewahan untuk mengompilasi target dengan cara yang kita inginkan. Kita harus menangani target yang dikompilasi sebagaimana adanya.</font></font></p>

<h2 id="common-strategies"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strategi Umum</font></font></h2>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Di bagian ini kita akan mulai melihat strategi umum yang digunakan alat fuzzing untuk mengumpulkan data cakupan kode.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="tracking-basic-blocks"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pelacakan Blok Dasar</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Salah satu cara paling sederhana untuk mengumpulkan cakupan kode adalah dengan melacak berapa banyak blok dasar yang dicapai oleh input tertentu. Anda dapat membayangkan bahwa kita sedang menjelajahi program target dengan input kita dan kita ingin tahu kode apa yang telah dicapai. Nah, kita tahu bahwa berdasarkan definisi blok dasar di atas, jika kita memasukkan blok dasar, kita akan mengeksekusi semua kode di dalamnya, jadi jika kita melacak apakah blok dasar telah dicapai atau tidak, kita setidaknya akan tahu jalur mana yang belum kita capai dan kita dapat memeriksanya secara manual.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pendekatan ini tidak terlalu canggih dan hanya menawarkan sedikit data cakupan dengan ketelitian tinggi; namun, sangat mudah diimplementasikan dan berfungsi dengan semua jenis target. Tidak punya sumber? Berikan beberapa breakpoint di sana. Tidak punya waktu untuk menulis kode kompiler? Berikan beberapa breakpoint di sana.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dari segi kinerja, teknik ini sangat bagus. Mencapai cakupan baru akan memerlukan pencapaian breakpoint, penghapusan breakpoint dan pemulihan konten asli yang ditimpa selama instrumentasi, penyimpanan input yang mencapai breakpoint, dan melanjutkan. Peristiwa ini sebenarnya akan berlangsung lambat saat terjadi; namun, seiring kemajuan Anda dalam kampanye fuzzing, cakupan baru akan semakin jarang. Jadi ada biaya awal yang akhirnya menurun hingga mendekati nol seiring berjalannya waktu.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Saya katakan bahwa berdasarkan pengalaman saya yang terbatas, jenis cakupan ini biasanya digunakan terhadap target sumber tertutup (hanya biner) di mana pilihan kita terbatas dan metode berteknologi rendah ini berfungsi cukup baik.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mari kita lihat @gamozolabs, alat pelacakan cakupan Basic Block yang sangat cepat yang disebut </font></font><a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/mesos"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mesos</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Anda dapat melihat bahwa alat ini ditujukan untuk digunakan pada Windows, di mana sebagian besar target hanya berupa biner. Hal yang menarik tentang alat ini adalah kinerjanya. Anda dapat melihat hasil benchmark-nya di </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:</font></font></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Registered    1000000 breakpoints in   0.162230 seconds |  6164072.8 / second<font></font>
Applied       1000000 breakpoints in   0.321347 seconds |  3111897.0 / second<font></font>
Cleared       1000000 breakpoints in   0.067024 seconds | 14920028.6 / second<font></font>
Hit            100000 breakpoints in  10.066440 seconds |     9934.0 / second<font></font>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satu hal yang perlu diingat adalah jika Anda menggunakan cara pengumpulan data cakupan ini, Anda mungkin membatasi diri pada input pertama yang mencapai blok dasar. Misalnya, kita memiliki kode berikut:</font></font></p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// input here is an unsigned char buff</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mh">0x9</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">220</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">parsing_routine_1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span><font></font>
<font></font>
<span class="k">else</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">parsing_routine_2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bahasa Indonesia: Jika input pertama kita untuk mencapai kode ini memiliki nilai </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">200</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">di dalam </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input[0x9]</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, maka kita akan melanjutkan ke </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parsing_routine_1</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">entri blok. Kita akan menghapus breakpoint kita di entri </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parsing_routine_1</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dan kita akan menambahkan input yang mencapainya ke korpus kita. Namun sekarang setelah kita mencapai blok kita dengan input yang memiliki nilai </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">200</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, kita agak terikat dengan nilai itu karena kita tidak akan pernah mencapai breakpoint ini lagi dengan nilai lain yang akan mencapainya juga. Jadi kita tidak akan pernah menyimpan input ke korpus yang "memecahkan" blok dasar ini dengan cara yang berbeda. Ini bisa jadi penting. Katakanlah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parsing_routine_1</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">then mengambil seluruh input, dan membaca input byte demi byte untuk keseluruhan panjang input dan melakukan semacam penguraian yang panjang di setiap iterasi. Dan katakanlah juga tidak ada rutinitas berikutnya yang sangat berstatus di mana input besar bervariasi drastis dari input yang lebih kecil dalam perilaku. Bagaimana jika input pertama yang kita berikan pada program yang memecahkan blok ini berukuran 1 MB? Fuzzer kami semacam menikah dengan input besar yang kami simpan dalam korpus dan kami agak kurang beruntung karena input yang lebih pendek tidak menyelesaikan blok ini terlebih dahulu dan ini dapat mengganggu kinerja.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Salah satu cara untuk mengatasi masalah ini adalah dengan membuat ulang semua breakpoint secara berkala. Katakanlah Anda telah menjalankan fuzzer untuk 10 miliar kasus fuzz dan belum menemukan cakupan baru dalam 24 jam, pada saat itu Anda dapat memasukkan semua breakpoint yang telah ditemukan sekali lagi dan mencoba memecahkan blok dengan cara yang berbeda, mungkin dengan menyimpan input yang lebih kecil dan berkinerja lebih baik yang memecahkan blok dengan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input[0x9] = 20</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Sebenarnya ada sejuta cara berbeda untuk memecahkan masalah ini. Saya yakin @gamozolabs telah membahas masalah ini sebelumnya di Twitter, tetapi saya tidak dapat menemukan postingannya.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secara keseluruhan, ini adalah metode cakupan yang benar-benar efektif terutama karena beragamnya target yang dituju dan betapa mudahnya penerapannya.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="tracking-edges-and-paths"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pelacakan Tepi dan Jalur</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pelacakan tepi sangat populer karena ini adalah strategi yang digunakan oleh AFL dan turunannya. Ini adalah pendekatan di mana kita tidak hanya peduli tentang blok dasar apa yang sedang diserang tetapi juga, hubungan apa yang sedang dieksplorasi antara blok dasar.</font></font></p>

<p><img src="https://h0mbre.github.io/assets/images/Fuzzing/AFLStats.PNG" alt=""></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Output statistik AFL++ memiliki referensi ke jalur dan tepi dan secara implisit 'penghitung'. Saya tidak 100% yakin, tetapi saya yakin definisi mereka tentang 'jalur' cocok dengan definisi kami di atas. Saya pikir mereka mengatakan bahwa 'jalur' sama dengan kasus uji dalam dokumentasi mereka.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Saya tidak akan terlalu mendalami analisis tentang bagaimana AFL dan turunannya (sebenarnya AFL++ sangat berbeda dengan AFL) mengumpulkan dan menganalisis liputan karena satu alasan sederhana: liputan ini ditujukan untuk orang-orang yang berotak besar dan saya tidak begitu memahaminya. Jika Anda tertarik dengan uraian yang lebih rinci, kunjungi dokumen mereka dan nikmati.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Untuk melacak tepi, AFL menggunakan tuple dari alamat blok yang terlibat dalam hubungan tersebut. Jadi dalam contoh program kami, jika kami berpindah dari satu blok </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ke blok lain </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006e4</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">karena kami tidak memberikan jumlah argumen baris perintah yang benar, tuple ini ( </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006e4</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) akan ditambahkan ke peta cakupan yang digunakan AFL++ untuk melacak jalur yang unik. Jadi mari kita lacak tuple yang akan kami daftarkan jika kami melintasi seluruh jalur dalam program kami:</font></font></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">-&gt; </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00100706</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">-&gt;</font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00100722</code></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jika kita mengambil jalur di atas, kita dapat merumuskan dua tupel data cakupan: ( </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00100706</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">) dan ( </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00100706</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00100722</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">). Ini dapat dicari dalam data cakupan AFL untuk melihat apakah hubungan ini telah dieksplorasi sebelumnya.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AFL tidak hanya melacak hubungan ini, tetapi juga melacak frekuensi. Misalnya, AFL mengetahui seberapa sering setiap sisi tertentu dicapai dan dieksplorasi.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Data cakupan semacam ini jauh lebih kompleks daripada sekadar melacak blok dasar yang dijangkau; namun, mendapatkan tingkat detail ini juga tidak semudah itu.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dalam kasus yang paling umum, AFL mendapatkan data ini dengan menggunakan instrumentasi waktu kompilasi pada target. Anda dapat mengompilasi target Anda, yang memiliki kode sumber, menggunakan kompiler AFL yang akan memancarkan kode terkompilasi dengan instrumentasi yang tertanam dalam target. Ini sangat bagus. Namun, ini memerlukan akses ke kode sumber yang tidak selalu memungkinkan.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AFL juga memiliki jawaban untuk target biner saja dan memanfaatkan emulator QEMU yang canggih untuk mengumpulkan data cakupan yang terperinci serupa. Emulator memiliki akses yang relatif bebas ke jenis data ini karena mereka harus mengambil instruksi target dan menafsirkannya (yang berarti mensimulasikan eksekusinya) atau mengompilasi blok secara JIT (just-in-time) menjadi kode asli dan mengeksekusinya secara asli. Dalam kasus QEMU di sini, blok di-JIT menjadi kode asli dan disimpan dalam cache sehingga dapat dengan mudah digunakan lagi oleh eksekusi berikutnya. Jadi, ketika QEMU menemukan blok dasar, ia dapat memeriksa apakah blok ini telah dikompilasi atau belum dan bertindak sesuai dengan itu. AFL menggunakan proses ini untuk melacak blok apa yang sedang dieksekusi dan mendapatkan data yang sangat mirip dengan apa yang dikumpulkannya dengan instrumentasi waktu kompilasi.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Saya tidak mengerti semua nuansanya di sini, tetapi blogpost yang bagus untuk dibaca tentang subjek ini adalah: </font></font><a href="https://abiondo.me/2018/09/21/improving-afl-qemu-mode/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">@abiondo's post yang menjelaskan pengoptimalan yang mereka buat pada mode AFL QEMU pada tahun 2018.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dalam ringkasan yang sangat singkat (semoga tidak terlalu tidak akurat), QEMU akan menghitung terlebih dahulu apa yang disebut lompatan langsung dan mengompilasi blok-blok tersebut menjadi satu blok pada dasarnya (dengan menjaga eksekusi dalam blok yang dikompilasi secara asli) sebagai cara untuk mempercepat berbagai hal. Ambil contoh mainan ini misalnya:</font></font></p>

<pre><code class="language-asm">ADD RAX, 0x8<font></font>
JMP LAB_0x00100738<font></font>
</code></pre>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Di sini kita memiliki tujuan pra-komputasi untuk lompatan kita. Kita mengetahui offset relatif ke </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_0x00100738</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dari alamat kita saat ini (nilai absolut dari </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">current_addr</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_0x00100738</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">), jadi dalam emulator kita bisa mengambil lompatan itu dan mengganti tujuan ke blok yang dikompilasi dari   </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LAB_0x00100738</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dan tidak ada perhitungan yang perlu dilakukan selama setiap eksekusi (hanya yang awal untuk menghitung offset relatif). Ini akan memungkinkan emulator untuk melanjutkan dengan eksekusi asli tanpa kembali ke apa yang saya sebut 'mode simulasi' di mana ia harus menghitung alamat sebelum melompat ke sana setiap kali dieksekusi. Ini disebut "block-chaining" di QEMU. Nah Anda dapat membayangkan bahwa jika ini terjadi, blok besar kode yang dieksekusi secara asli (yang sebenarnya dua blok) sama sekali tidak terlihat oleh AFL karena tidak menyadari bahwa dua blok terkandung dan sehingga tidak dapat mencatat tepi yang diambil. Jadi sebagai solusi, AFL akan menambal QEMU untuk tidak lagi melakukan block-chaining ini dan menjaga setiap blok tetap terisolasi sehingga tepi dapat dilacak. Ini berarti bahwa pada akhir setiap blok, lompatan langsung atau tidak, QEMU akan kembali ke 'mode simulasi' yang akan menimbulkan penalti kinerja.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pastikan untuk membaca blogpost @abiondo, itu jauh lebih informatif.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jika Anda bertanya-tanya apa itu lompatan tidak langsung, itu adalah sesuatu yang lokasi lompatannya hanya diketahui pada waktu eksekusi, sesuatu yang bisa terlihat seperti ini dalam contoh mainan:</font></font></p>

<pre><code class="language-asm">ADD RAX, 0x8<font></font>
JMP RAX<font></font>
</code></pre>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satu-satunya masalah dengan penggunaan QEMU untuk mengumpulkan data cakupan adalah relatif lambat dibandingkan dengan eksekusi asli murni. Perlambatan ini tentu saja sepadan karena jumlah data yang Anda dapatkan cukup besar dan terkadang dengan target biner saja tidak ada alternatif lain.</font></font></p>

<h3 id="compare-coveragecompare-shattering"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bandingkan Cakupan/Bandingkan Penghancuran</font></font></h3>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alih-alih sekadar melacak masukan atau kemajuan pengujian melalui blok/tepi program, cakupan pembanding berupaya memahami seberapa besar kemajuan yang dicapai pengujian kita dalam perbandingan program. Perbandingan dapat dilakukan dengan berbagai cara, tetapi cara umum sudah ada dalam contoh program kata sandi kita. Di </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">001006cf</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">blok, kita memiliki </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMP</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operasi yang dilakukan di sini:</font></font></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMP		dword ptr [RBP + local_1c], 0x2</code></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dword</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">adalah nilai 4 byte (32 bit) dan operasi ini mengambil </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">argc</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nilai kita dalam program kita dan membandingkannya dengan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">untuk memeriksa berapa banyak argumen baris perintah yang diberikan. Jadi dua operan perbandingan kita adalah apa pun yang ada di tumpukan pada offset </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RBP + local_1c</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Jika operan ini sama, Zero Flag akan ditetapkan dan kita dapat memanfaatkan lompatan bersyarat dengan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">untuk bergerak sesuai dengan itu dalam program.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Namun masalahnya, karena berkaitan dengan fuzzing, perbandingan ini agak biner. Perbandingan ini menetapkan Zero Flag atau tidak, tidak ada nuansa. Kita tidak dapat mengatakan seberapa dekat kita melewati perbandingan, untuk menetapkan Zero Flag.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jadi misalnya, katakanlah kita melakukan perbandingan dengan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xdeadbeef</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">alih-alih </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x2</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Dalam kasus itu, jika kita akan menyerahkan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xdeadbebe</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">operan yang lain, kita akan jauh lebih dekat untuk memenuhi </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JZ</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kondisi yang akan kita dapatkan jika kita menyerahkan </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x0</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pada tingkat tinggi, cakupan perbandingan membagi perbandingan ini menjadi beberapa bagian sehingga kemajuan melalui perbandingan dapat dilacak dengan lebih terperinci daripada LULUS/GAGAL biner. Jadi, dengan menggunakan cakupan perbandingan, perbandingan ini dapat ditulis ulang sebagai berikut:</font></font></p>

<p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SEBELUM:</font></font></strong></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apakah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xdeadbebe</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">== </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xdeadbeef</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">?</font></font></p>

<p><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SETELAH:</font></font></strong></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apakah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xde</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">== </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xde</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">? Jika ya, catat bahwa kita telah mencocokkan byte pertama, dan</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">apakah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xad</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">== </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xad</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">? Jika ya, catat bahwa kita telah mencocokkan byte kedua, dan</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">apakah </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xbe</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">== </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xbe</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">? Jika ya, catat bahwa kita telah mencocokkan byte ketiga, dan</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">does </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xbe</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">== </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xef</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">? Jika ya, catat bahwa kita telah mencocokkan kedua operan secara lengkap.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dalam penulisan ulang </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AFTER</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , alih-alih mendapatkan PASS/FAIL biner, kami malah melihat bahwa kami telah maju 75% dari perbandingan dengan mencocokkan 3 dari 4 byte. Sekarang kami tahu bahwa kami dapat menyimpan masukan ini dan mengubahnya lebih lanjut dengan harapan bahwa kami dapat melewati perbandingan byte terakhir dengan mutasi yang benar.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kita juga tidak dibatasi untuk hanya membagi setiap perbandingan ke dalam byte, kita dapat membandingkan dua operan pada tingkat bit. Misalnya, kita juga dapat membandingkannya sebagai berikut:</font></font></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1110 1111</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">melawan</font></font></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1101 1110 1010 1101 1011 1110 1011 1110</code></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ini dapat dipecah menjadi 32 perbandingan terpisah, bukan 4 seperti yang kita lakukan, sehingga memberi kita lebih banyak kesetiaan dan pelacakan kemajuan (mungkin dengan mengorbankan kinerja dalam praktik).</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Di sini kami mengambil perbandingan 4 byte dan membaginya menjadi 4 perbandingan byte tunggal yang terpisah. Ini juga dikenal sebagai "Compare Shattering". Secara garis besar, ini sangat mirip dengan compare coverage. Ini semua tentang membagi perbandingan besar menjadi potongan-potongan yang lebih kecil sehingga kemajuan dapat dilacak dengan lebih akurat.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Beberapa fuzzer mengambil semua operan perbandingan, seperti </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xdeadbeef</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dalam contoh ini, dan menambahkannya ke semacam kamus nilai ajaib yang akan dimasukkan secara acak oleh fuzzer ke dalam inputnya dengan harapan dapat melewati perbandingan di masa mendatang.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anda dapat membayangkan skenario di mana sebuah program memeriksa nilai yang besar sebelum bercabang ke rutinitas kompleks yang perlu dieksplorasi. Melewati pemeriksaan ini sangatlah sulit hanya dengan cakupan dasar dan akan memerlukan banyak interaksi manusia. Seseorang dapat memeriksa grafik berwarna di IDA yang menampilkan blok yang telah dicapai dan mencoba mencari tahu secara manual apa yang mencegah fuzzer mencapai blok yang belum dicapai dan menentukan bahwa perbandingan 32 byte yang besar telah gagal. Seseorang kemudian dapat menyesuaikan fuzzer mereka untuk memperhitungkan perbandingan ini melalui kamus atau apa pun, tetapi proses ini semuanya sangat manual.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ada beberapa cara yang benar-benar menarik/sangat teknis untuk melakukan hal jenis ini pada target dengan target sumber dan target biner saja!</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AFL++ memiliki mode LLVM tempat Anda dapat memanfaatkan apa yang mereka sebut "instrumentasi laf-intel" yang dijelaskan </font></font><a href="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/3b799c09cd68bb68b26784261f1fbaa3e737c747/instrumentation/README.laf-intel.md"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">di sini</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> dan awalnya ditulis </font></font><a href="https://lafintel.wordpress.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">di sini</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Langsung dari blogpost laf-intel, kita dapat melihat contoh mereka tampak sangat mirip dengan eksperimen pemikiran yang telah kita lalui di mana mereka memiliki kode sumber ini:</font></font></p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">0xabad1dea</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="cm">/* terribly buggy code */</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="cm">/* secure code */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dan potongan kode ini 'dioptimalkan' menjadi beberapa perbandingan yang lebih kecil sehingga fuzzer dapat mengukur kemajuannya:</font></font></p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">24</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">0xab</span><span class="p">){</span>

      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mh">0xff</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mh">0xea</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="cm">/* terrible code */</span>
        <span class="k">goto</span> <span class="n">end</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span><font></font>
<font></font>
<span class="cm">/* good code */</span><font></font>
<font></font>
<span class="n">end</span><span class="o">:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kode yang tidak dioptimalkan ini dapat dipancarkan saat seseorang memilih untuk menentukan variabel lingkungan tertentu dan menggunakannya </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afl-clang-fast</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">untuk mengompilasi target.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ini sangat pintar dan benar-benar dapat menghilangkan banyak sekali tenaga manual dalam pengaburan.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tetapi apa yang harus kita lakukan ketika kita tidak memiliki akses ke kode sumber dan target biner saja kita mungkin penuh dengan perbandingan yang besar?</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Untungnya, ada juga solusi open-source untuk masalah ini. Mari kita lihat salah satunya yang disebut " </font></font><a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TinyInst</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " oleh @ifsecure dan kawan-kawan. Saya tidak bisa membahas secara mendalam cara kerja alat ini secara teknis karena saya belum pernah menggunakannya, tetapi penjelasannya </font></font><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cukup deskriptif!</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seperti yang dapat kita lihat, alat ini ditujukan untuk target MacOS dan Windows sesuai dengan tujuannya untuk menginstrumentasikan target biner saja. TinyInst memberi kita cakupan dengan menginstrumentasikan rutin pilihan melalui debugger untuk mengubah izin eksekusi sehingga setiap eksekusi (tidak membaca atau menulis karena izin ini dipertahankan) akses ke kode yang diinstrumentasikan menghasilkan kesalahan yang kemudian ditangani oleh debugger TinyInst di mana eksekusi kode dialihkan ke rutin/modul yang diinstrumentasikan yang ditulis ulang. Jadi TinyInst memblokir semua eksekusi modul asli dan sebagai gantinya, mengalihkan semua eksekusi itu ke modul yang ditulis ulang yang dimasukkan ke dalam program. Anda dapat melihat betapa hebatnya hal ini karena dapat memungkinkan pemecahan perbandingan besar menjadi yang jauh lebih kecil dengan cara yang sangat mirip dengan metode laf-intel tetapi untuk target yang sudah dikompilasi. Lihat gif keren ini yang menunjukkan cakupan perbandingan dalam tindakan dari @ifsecure: [https://twitter.com/ifsecure/status/1298341219614031873?s=20]. Anda dapat melihat bahwa ia memiliki program yang memeriksa nilai 8 byte, dan fuzzernya membuat kemajuan bertahap melaluinya hingga menyelesaikan perbandingan.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ada beberapa alat lain di luar sana yang bekerja secara teori mirip dengan TinyInst yang tentunya layak untuk dicermati dan juga disebutkan dalam README, alat-alat seperti: </font></font><a href="https://dynamorio.org/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">DynamoRIO</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> dan </font></font><a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PIN</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perlu juga disebutkan bahwa AFL++ juga memiliki kemampuan untuk melakukan pelacakan cakupan perbandingan bahkan dalam mode QEMU.</font></font></p>

<h2 id="bonus-land-using-hardware-to-get-coverage-data"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bonus Land: Menggunakan Perangkat Keras untuk Mendapatkan Data Cakupan</font></font></h2>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Itu cukup merangkum dasar-dasar jenis data yang kami minati, mengapa, dan bagaimana kami dapat mengekstraknya. Satu jenis metode ekstraksi data yang belum muncul yang sangat membantu untuk target biner saja adalah memanfaatkan perangkat keras Anda yang sebenarnya untuk mendapatkan data cakupan.</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meskipun ini bukan benar-benar 'strategi' seperti yang lain, ini memungkinkan pelaksanaan strategi yang disebutkan di atas dan belum disebutkan sebelumnya. Kami tidak akan membahasnya terlalu dalam di sini. Saat ini, CPU dilengkapi dengan semua jenis utilitas yang ditujukan untuk pembuatan profil kinerja dengan ketelitian tinggi. Jenis utilitas ini juga dapat digunakan untuk memberi kita data cakupan.</font></font></p>

<p><a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/processor-tracing.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intel-PT</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> adalah utilitas yang ditawarkan oleh CPU Intel yang lebih baru yang memungkinkan Anda mengekstrak informasi tentang perangkat lunak yang Anda jalankan seperti alur kontrol. Setiap utas perangkat keras memiliki kemampuan untuk menyimpan data tentang aplikasi yang dijalankannya. Kendala besar dalam penggunaan jejak prosesor adalah bahwa mendekode data jejak yang dikumpulkan selalu sangat lambat dan rumit untuk digunakan. Namun, baru-baru ini, @is_eqv dan @ms_s3c mampu membuat pustaka yang sangat berkinerja tinggi yang disebut </font></font><a href="https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/libxdc"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">libxdc</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> yang dapat digunakan untuk mendekode data jejak Intel-PT secara berkinerja tinggi. Grafik yang disertakan dalam README mereka sangat keren, Anda dapat melihat seberapa cepat grafik tersebut dibandingkan dengan alat fuzzing berpemandu cakupan bersumber perangkat keras lainnya sambil juga mengumpulkan data cakupan dengan fidelitas tertinggi, yang mereka sebut "Cakupan Tepi Penuh". Mendapatkan data cakupan Anda langsung dari CPU tampaknya ideal haha. Jadi bagi mereka untuk dapat merekayasa pustaka yang memberi Anda apa yang pada dasarnya merupakan cakupan yang sempurna, dan omong-omong, tidak memerlukan kode sumber, tampaknya merupakan pencapaian yang substansial. Saya pribadi tidak memiliki kemampuan teknik untuk menangani jenis cakupan ini saat ini, tetapi suatu hari nanti. Banyak fuzzer populer dapat menggunakan Intel-PT langsung dari kotaknya, fuzzer seperti: AFL++, </font></font><a href="https://github.com/google/honggfuzz"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">honggfuzz</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , dan </font></font><a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WinAFL</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Masih banyak utilitas lain seperti itu, tetapi semuanya berada di luar cakupan blog pengantar ini.</font></font></p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kesimpulan</font></font></h2>

<p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dalam posting ini, kami membahas beberapa terminologi dasar yang digunakan dalam bidang ini, beberapa strategi dasar yang sangat umum yang digunakan untuk mendapatkan data cakupan yang bermakna, dan juga beberapa perkakas yang digunakan untuk mengekstrak data (dan dalam beberapa kasus, kerangka kerja fuzzing apa yang menggunakan perkakas apa). Perlu disebutkan bahwa kerangka kerja fuzzing populer seperti AFL++ dan honggfuzz berupaya keras untuk membuat kerangka kerja mereka sefleksibel mungkin dan bekerja dengan berbagai macam target. Mereka sering memberi Anda banyak fleksibilitas untuk menggunakan metode ekstraksi data cakupan yang paling sesuai dengan situasi Anda. Semoga ini sedikit membantu untuk mulai memahami beberapa masalah yang terkait dengan cakupan kode yang berkaitan dengan fuzzing.</font></font></p>
